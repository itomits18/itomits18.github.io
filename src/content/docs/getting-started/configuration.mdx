# Project Configuration

This project uses a combination of **environment variables** and optional **YAML/JSON configuration files** to manage configuration settings across different environments (development, staging, production).
To ensure the project runs smoothly, please follow the configuration setup outlined below. This includes setting up your environment file, Docker containers, and Postman collection.


## 1. Environment Setup

<Steps>

    1. Create a `.env` file

        Duplicate the example file provided in the project root:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

2. Adjust the values

    Modify the .env values according to your local setup or development environment (e.g., database driver, ports, credentials).

3. Supported Drivers

    The project currently supports:
    - SQLite
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL

</Steps>

## 2. Docker Configuration
Docker is used to manage containerized services (such as the database). To spin up all necessary services, follow these steps:

<Steps> 

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed

    Download: https://docs.docker.com/desktop

2. Start Docker daemon

    Make sure Docker is running before proceeding.

3. Run the containers

    In the project root directory, execute:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Tear down containers (when done)

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ``` 
</Steps>

## 3. Postman Configuration
This project uses Postman to manage and test the API endpoints.

<Tabs> 
<TabItem label="Import Collection"> 
- Open Postman - Click **Import** 
- Select the `.postman_collection.json` file from the repository (if provided) 
</TabItem> 

<TabItem label="Set Environment"> 
- Import `.postman_environment.json` file 
- Configure base URL and authentication token if needed 
</TabItem> 
</Tabs>

Don't forget to update Postman environment variables like BASE_URL, AUTH_TOKEN, etc., if required.
