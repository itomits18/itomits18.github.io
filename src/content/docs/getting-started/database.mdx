# Database

This project supports multiple database engines (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and uses migration and seeder systems to manage schema and initial data.

---

## 1. Supported Databases

The following database drivers are supported via the `.env` file:

| Driver       | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `sqlite`     | Lightweight file-based DB          |
| `postgres`   | Recommended for production use     |
| `mysql`      | Widely-used relational database    |

Set the `DB_DRIVER` variable in `.env` accordingly.

## 2. Migrations

Database migrations are used to define and apply schema changes.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the `database/migrations/up` directory

   This folder contains all the SQL migration files used to create tables.

2. Apply Migrations

   Depending on your DB driver, you can execute the `.sql` files manually or integrate with a migration tool.

   Example for PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   psql -U POSTGRES_USER -d POSTGRES_DB -f database/migrations/up/schema.sql

3. Rollback (Optional)
    
    The database/migrations/down directory contains rollback scripts to undo changes.

</Steps>
Always back up your database before applying down migrations.

## 3. Seeders
Seeders populate the database with initial or sample data.

<Steps> 
1. Go to the `database/seeders` directory

    You`ll find Go-based seeders for various services:
    - meilisearch.go
    - redis.go
    - s3.go
    - sql.go

2. Run Seeders (if integrated)
    
    You may run the seeders via Go if they`re wired in the main.go or part of bootstrap/init.go.
    Example:

    ```bash
    go run bootstrap/init.go
    ```
3. Custom Seeder

    You can write your own seeder script to populate additional tables as needed.

</Steps>

## 4. Entity Relationship Diagram

    The schema folder contains .puml files used to visualize table relations using PlantUML.

| File	                        | Description                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| participant_schema.puml       | ERD of participants, regions, etc.    |
| role_permission_schema.puml   | ERD of roles and permissions          |

You can render them using tools like PlantUML Live or VSCode plugins.
