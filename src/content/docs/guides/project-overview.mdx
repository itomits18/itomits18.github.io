# Backend Project Overview - `OMITS18`

This document provides a technical overview of the OMITS18 backend project built using Go, GraphQL (`gqlgen`), Docker, and modular architecture. The purpose is to guide developers in understanding the core structure and how to get started with the service.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular design for scalability and maintainability. Below is a summary of the major directories and their purposes:

| Directory       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/`         | Application logic such as use cases, handlers, and services.                |
| `bootstrap/`   | Initial setup logic (e.g., DB connection, server start, logger init).       |
| `config/`      | Configuration loading from environment or static files.                     |
| `database/`    | Database connection, schema migrations, and repository patterns.            |
| `pkg/`         | Common utilities (e.g., logger, JWT helpers, error formatter).              |
| `routes/`      | Route and resolver configuration, REST or GraphQL entry points.             |
| `tests/`       | Unit tests and integration test files.                                      |
| `tools/`       | Internal CLI tools or scripts for schema generation, seeding, etc.         |
| `volume/`      | Persistent volume setup for Docker (used for local storage or mock files).  |
